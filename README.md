I have developed this application using ASP.NET Core 8 and SQL Server. The database is connected to the application, and the dropdown lists are populated from database tables.

Before running the application, it is mandatory to execute the SQL scripts to create the required database objects and seed the necessary data.

I have implemented Data Annotations for validation, so data must be entered strictly according to the defined validation rules.
